# Cornerstone Tools Plugin: Image Statistics

This repository implements the ["Image Statistics"](https://github.com/cornerstonejs/cornerstoneTools/blob/317e8fa4925b018dee76ec0dbf1e452c1ef93cd0/src/imageTools/imageStats.js) tool that was available in CornerstoneTools v2, but removed in v3. It demonstrates how to implement the tool using version 3's ["plugins"](https://tools.cornerstonejs.org/custom-tools/).

This repository also serves as a very basic example and template for creating a listing on the [Cornerstone.js Market](https://cornerstonejsmarket.io).
